### Lagrange's Equation
If your lovely teacher said Lagrange without further explanation, she means the ordinary form of Lagrange's Equation, which may be called d'Alembert's Equation:
- [Wolfram: Lagrange's Equation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LagrangesEquation.html)
- [Wolfram: d'Alembert's Equation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/dAlembertsEquation.html)
- Quoting [Ordinary Differential Equations](https://annas-archive.org/md5/4aaba2636f7a8b23f3a7200e7f939bd9), 2.44. Equations linear in x and y, p. 38:
    > The equations appear to have been integrated by John Bernoulli before the year 1694. Its singular solutions were studied
by d'Alembert, Hist. Acad. Berlin 4 (1748), p. 275.
- Quoting [Handbook of Differential Equations](https://annas-archive.org/md5/49f513e7bc62370eae64309c5d3309e7), 81. Lagrange's Equation, p. 365:
    > Equation (81.1)  is known as dâ€™Alembertâ€™s equation and also as an equation linear in x and y.

### First Order Non-Linear / First Order Higher Degree
If your lovely teacher was solving equations about this, she may without mentioning solve an equation that is a particular case of Lagrange's / d'Alembert's equation called The Clairaut equation:
- [Wolfram: Clairaut's Differential Equation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ClairautsDifferentialEquation.html)
- [Wikipedia: Clairaut's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clairaut%27s_equation)

Do NOT be confused with Euler-Lagrange Differential Equation:
